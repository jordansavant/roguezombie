TODO:
Left off with level transition queue working.
Need to test for disconnections while in the queue (should work).

Add tile priority to entrance selection

Wire up a game victory event and game defeat event states.

Add the ability to spectate with other players if there are still living players.
	- spectating characters
Try not to do a forced immediate kick of all players when the game ends so that the server
 can keep on living, just the ability to move between any character, even dead ones for fade etc.

Client side needs to support modes: LevelTransition, JoiningServer
Server side needs to support AI/visual issues for level transition: turn queue, visuals, death etc
