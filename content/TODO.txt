TODO:
Left off with player join working in a queue system, now we need to get level transition working.
Test that we can transition between levels using enterEvents and exitEvents on tiles.
Make it work with out of room scenarios as well.

Wire up a game victory event and game defeat event states.

Add the ability to spectate with other players if there are still living players.
	- spectating characters
Try not to do a forced immediate kick of all players when the game ends so that the server
 can keep on living, just the ability to move between any character, even dead ones for fade etc.
