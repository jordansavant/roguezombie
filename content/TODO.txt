TODO:
Update events to check for non playing players (dead etc) and end game in defeat
	- When a player character dies
	- When a player disconnects
	- Should not explode players

Have to keep the game from crashing if:
	- No spectateable character can be found
	- See rules below
	
Add better spectateNext() method
	- Only support spectating other players
		- If there are no other players then it should technically be game over
			- Regardless there are scenarios where we cannot rely on this:
				- All players have disconnected
		- In the player keep 
	- One command should toggle next characters on level
		- Finds current character on level
		- Looks for next character, round robins back to beginning
		- If no character is found run spectate for next player
	- One command should toggle next players across levels
		- 
		
	Character switch routine: must traverse characters across levels
		- Player has a current level and a spectatee on that level
		- On Command
			- Get next character on current level
			- If character
				- switch as spectator
			- If no character
				- Ask server to look for another character on the next level
				- Server iterates levels to find current level
				- Server finds next level with a character
					- Server moves the spectator to that level and that first character
					- END
				- If no other level
					- END
			
		
		
Client side needs to support modes: LevelTransition, JoiningServer
