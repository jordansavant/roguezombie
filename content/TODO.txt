TODO:
Left off at getting to the point of new functionality for spawning players.
I have tiledefs wired up for entrances and levels loading from server down.

I need to support entrances in-game for Tile objects.
I need to support finding entrances by id within tiles.
I need to support creating character instances and placing them at the entrances based on available priority.
I need to support the fact that we might not have room on a tile (queuing from server).

Create more than one level and wire up their entrances.
Test that we can transition between levels using enterEvents and exitEvents on tiles.

Wire up a game victory event and game defeat event.
Add support for client side game victory and game defeat server disconnection and new state etc.

Add the ability to spectate with other players if there are still living players.
Try not to do a forced immediate kick of all players when the game ends so that the server
can keep on living, just the ability to move between any character, even dead ones for fade
