Leveling System

Levels
- In an RPG a character will acrue experience points for performing actions
	- Some games reward experience points for winning combat scenarios (kill a troll = 100 xp etc)
	- Some games for completing quests
	- Some games for individual successfull actions
- Morrowind games have both an overall level system and a level system for the passive skills
	- Heavy Armor increases in levels, each time you are struck with heavy armor the Heavy Armor skill increases in XP until the next level is reached
	- The overal level usually allows for unlocking new abilities and perks
- An overall level system allows for defining the rough power of a character and helps to tailor content to players of a certain experience
	- Dungeons can be dynamic with their enemies generated at the time the dungeon is entered at the same lvl + 10% of the player
	- Loot finds can be roughly equivalent to the players level as well
- Levels also allow for tying gear to characters making high level gear unusable until you reach those levels
	- This is problematic and unrealistic IMO
- Most games institute a level cap for sanity and to balance the game

Statistics
- Tangible ints that represent physical and mental attributes
- When a new level is reached, points can be allocated into a statistic
- Most stat systems in RPG's allow for X number of stat points to be assigned per level
- Raising stats often have an increasing requirement
	- E.g. going from 4 to 5 may cost one stat point, whereas going from 9 to 10 may cost 2
	- These systems usually display stats in meters or slots because raising an int one point with two points is illogical
- RPG's tend to use a statistic to effect actions
	- E.g. higher strength increases melee damage, dex = accuracy and intelligence = spell power
	- In dice games, the player can roll a dice equivalent to the typical stat level, if the roll is under the stat then its a success
		- problems here include:
		   the dice is constant i.e. d20
		   the result is a boolean, not a factor
	- Some games use the stat and compare it to a target int to get a floating point ratio, this is used to affect success of an action
		- e.g dex target is 20, character dex is 25, dex factor is 1.25
		- this lends itself well to helping or hurting a success roll and works well with other ratio based factors like environment
		- The problem here is still the "target" value of a stat, and balancing how hard that is to reach
	- The float based stat usage is most ideal for a videogame because its more flexible and the math is done by the machine anyway
	- Samuel's concept of a perfection / penalty is interesting, treating the target value as a perfect score and an asymptote
	- Problem though is that it is not rewarding for the player to grind toward imperfection, and deciding on a perfect value is the same problem
	
Skills
- Skills can represent active and tangible actions or passive influences
- An active skill is an action that ends in direct action from a character
	- Example: Sweep attack, Eat enemy, Disappear etc.
- A passive influence skill is not an action, but effects the outcome of actions by specialized influences not covered by the broader stat
	- Example: rifle mastery (increase CoH with rifles), Toxification (reduce time it takes for enemies to turn)
- RPGs generally lay out skills in a tree format, requiring minimum basic skills to reach more advanced skills
- The trees tend to create a character "build"
- Skills generally allow for Skill Points to be assigned to them to some maximum
	- Action skills like Bash may require 1 skill point to simply unlock and has no upgrades
	- Investing more points into an action skill may unlock upgrades that directly inprove that action
	- Passive skills like combat mastery may allow for many skill points to be invested to slowly improve the effect
- Table top RPGs tend to allow for subexperience system in skills where you invest points into skills and they become harder to upgrade
	- Some systems use a scaling formula like Fibonacci meaning 1 pt for lvl 1, 3 pt for lvl 2 etc.
	- Again these systems are simpler since the math is done manually
- It has become common in recent RPGs to allow a player to respec, meaning reallocate all Stat Points and Skill points
	- This allows a player to correct mistakes or change undesirable builds
	- Not as common in permadeath roguelikes that try to mimic real life and put heavy emphasis permanent decisions
//// RZ IMPLEMENTATION ////
	Skills could be a combination of points and experience levels
	- Skill points could be used to unlock abilities
	- Using abilities would increase their XP and their upgrades would come on their own
	- Pros
		- Better feel of character progression where the player can grow stronger over time without grinding to a magical level up
		- Better models real life where a skill only gets better with use
		- Can still have specific levels of upgrades and caps
		- Can make expanding the skill tree less time consuming so that builds are created naturally and not by player decision
			- I mean, instead of it takine 50 levels to unlock one tree, it could take 50 levels to unlock all tree nodes
			  then using skills determines the builds as they grow stronger only through use
		- Mitigates stupidity where the player kills 700 orcs with a sword an puts points in his rifle skill
	- Cons
		- Makes respeccing impossible (not a common roguelike element anyway)
		- Tracking experience becomes a little more of a pain (not really)
	- Skill trees are still designed by us

Perks
- The fallout games made wonderful use of Perks that were provided every other level
- Perks were very similar to passive skills as they did not open up direct action abilities
- Perks were much more affective of the environment and gameplace
	- Explorer perk revealed more map
	- Risky Dingo increased chance of being seen in sneak but offered better loot overall
- Some perks also directly effected dialog
- Perks were also level capped to prevent them from being unlocked to quickly
