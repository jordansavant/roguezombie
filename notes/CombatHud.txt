onPlayerDecisionStateEnterPacketEvent
	Serverside
		Bucket fill all non blocked tiles around player origin into list of positions
		Send list to client as part of event packet
	Clientside
		unpack positions
		for each position, fill with quad

onPlayerDecisionStateLeavePacketEvent
	Serverside
		Send event packet
	Client side
		loop over quads and hide them
		
* Render move markers between the tiles and the characters
* std::vector of move markers, if 25 come in, position first 25, store the 25 count 		
  then on leave just iterate those same 25 and hide them this way its always the minimum
