// Sample entity

Zombie
{
    int id;         // full
    int x, y;       // delta
    int health;     // delta
    int maxHealth;  // full
}

Client connects so full Packet is sent as snapshot 1
Client acks full packet
Zombie A moves and is hurt x++, health--
Server simulates
Server sends snapshot 2


Snapshot 1 (Zombie Instance)
id  = 1
x = 3
y = 3
health = 100
maxHealth = 100

$lastAckId = 1

Snapshot 2
id  = 1
x = 3
y = 3
health = 99
maxHealth = 100

DeltaSnapshot delta(Snapshot 1, Snapshot 2)
{
    snapshotPacket;

    if(s1.x != s2.x)
        snapshotPacket << "x" << s2.x
    if(s1.y != s2.y)
        snapshotPacket << "y" << s2.y
    if(s1.health != s2.health)
        snapshotPacket << "health" << s2.health
}

DeltaSnapshot for Client
x=3
y=3
health=99
