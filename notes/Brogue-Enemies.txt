OOD and Depth

An enemy is spawned in two factors: OOD (Out of Depth) and Depth. Each represents the depth or level that the monster can be found in.

Depth - represents the level that the monster can be found as a normal spawn
OOD - represents the earliest level that the monster can spawn in as a rare spawn

This ensures that enemies can be engineered for higher difficulties. When appearing in OOD they are like mini-bosses.
Depth is always higher than OOD. OOD is usually between 1 and 3 levels lower than depth.



Stats

Enemies also have four primary stats: MD (Movement Delay), AD (Attack Delay), Damage and HP

MD - Number of turns it takes for movement
AD - Number of turns it takes per attack
Damage - a range (such as 4-12) they can hit for generated in a Clumping distribution.
HP - Health of the enemy
XP - Amount of XP rewarded for dispatching
Sight - Unsure, but likely range of vision for hostility checks, and ability to overcome stealth checks
Scent - Unsure, but likey used in stealth detection or observing non-visible enemies or yourself (if your scent is stronger due to effects or items?)
Regen - Number of turns to regenerate 1 health



Ranged / Quirks / Mutations

Ranged - powers and attacks that can be used at a range. Enemies also can have ranged attacks and quirks that define their behavior.
Quirks - movement and attack behavior, passive effects, attack effects etc.
Mutations - at higher levels one mutation can exist on monsters, which give boosts to stats, health or attacks

A common quirk is "flitting" which is generally seen on flying characters to emulate random flying positioning.
Quirks also include status powers, such as inanimate, which grants immunity to certain powers.
An example mutation is Explosive, where radial damage occurs on death, or vampiric which regens health on melee attack.
