RZ Bugs

Body's are LevelRunnable but if we delete one it will screw up references in the parent tile
- Tiles point to structures, doors or characters on them, deleting them needs to remove references
- Or protect against deleting them somehow

Tooltips dont appear sometimes, like over action icons
- THis is because there is one instance of the tooltip
- When an exit event hides it will propogate after the enter event for the nearby element
- If we support a Pool of tooltips we can throw one away and grab a new one on each request

Tile targetting colors merge weird
- Relook at using the new ColorMixer, or doing some other visualization
- Grenade is what I'm talking about

Can't drag usable items off of the action bar
- e.g. medkit, I made it where you can use it in free mode
- If you try and drag it away it will treat it like a click activation

Its possible that an enemy can face the wrong direction when firing
- Inthe demo level, last two guys, stand in the doorway and the top one will face the wrong way


RZ Features

When a character attacks we should show graphics for attack and harm as well as sounds

Need to ambient music, environmental sounds

Need sound effects
- When a weapon is fired
- When a character is killed
- When an explosion occurs
- For healing/item use
- For item throwing (brick hitting someone)

Stairwell graphic tiles (NSEW, Up and Down)

Need much better AI for Hunters
- They should take cover
- They should flee
- They should make chase - If they encounter the player and the player breaks LoS, they should go to the player's last seen location
- They should have group tactics (spread out around player)

Better stat details in the window

Items should have stat effects and perhaps magical (lambda) effects
- Maybe rarity (green/blue/purple/orange)?
