RZ Bugs

Body's are LevelRunnable but if we delete one it will screw up references in the parent tile
- Tiles point to structures, doors or characters on them, deleting them needs to remove references
- Or protect against deleting them somehow

Tooltips dont appear sometimes, like over action icons
- THis is because there is one instance of the tooltip
- When an exit event hides it will propogate after the enter event for the nearby element
- If we support a Pool of tooltips we can throw one away and grab a new one on each request

Can't drag usable items off of the action bar
- e.g. medkit, I made it where you can use it in free mode
- If you try and drag it away it will treat it like a click activation
- I tried adding drag checks and ignoring activation and it did not work most of the time
- This is because
	- draggable is updated (and onDragDrop is run) in the element->update
	- element->update is called in the primary container loop
	- after the loop for the container updateInput is called which checks activation on focused child
	- when the update runs, drop event fires which in turn causes the child to be moved to a new parent slot
	- if the slot is later down the update list in their shared parent it will transfer the child into its custody
	- once in its custody it will run updateInput for its own children which will fire the activation routine, meanwhile the update operation has cleared any drag details
- going to try
	- instead of running updateInput after the big loop im going to check for child focus and run it inline
	- this is a pretty risky change

Its possible that an enemy can face the wrong direction when firing
- Inthe demo level, last two guys, stand in the doorway and the top one will face the wrong way

Move colors out of RZConfig since its Client Specific

Hunters firing after dead
- Ive seen flare visualization after they are killed


RZ Features

When a character attacks we should show graphics for attack and harm as well as sounds

Need to ambient music, environmental sounds

Need sound effects
- When a weapon is fired
- When a character is killed
- When an explosion occurs
- For healing/item use
- For item throwing (brick hitting someone)

Stairwell graphic tiles (NSEW, Up and Down)

Need much better AI for Hunters
- They should take cover
- They should flee
- They should make chase - If they encounter the player and the player breaks LoS, they should go to the player's last seen location
- They should have group tactics (spread out around player)

Better stat details in the window

Items should have stat effects and perhaps magical (lambda) effects
- Maybe rarity (green/blue/purple/orange)?
