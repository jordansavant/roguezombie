RZ Bugs

Body's are LevelRunnable but if we delete one it will screw up references in the parent tile
- Tiles point to structures, doors or characters on them, deleting them needs to remove references
- Or protect against deleting them somehow*

Move colors out of RZConfig since its Client Specific

Hunters firing after dead
- Ive seen flare visualization after they are killed



RZ Features

When a character attacks we should show graphics for attack and harm as well as sounds

Need to ambient music, environmental sounds

Need sound effects
- When a weapon is fired
- When a character is killed
- When an explosion occurs
- For healing/item use
- For item throwing (brick hitting someone)

Stairwell graphic tiles (NSEW, Up and Down)

Need much better AI for Hunters
- They should take cover
- They should flee
- They should make chase - If they encounter the player and the player breaks LoS, they should go to the player's last seen location
- They should have group tactics (spread out around player)

Better stat details in the window

Items should have stat effects and perhaps magical (lambda) effects
- Maybe rarity (green/blue/purple/orange)?



RZ Potential issues

Doorways can be blocked if bodies die in front of them
