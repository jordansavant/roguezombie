RZ Bugs

Body's are LevelRunnable but if we delete one it will screw up references in the parent tile
- Tiles point to structures, doors or characters on them, deleting them needs to remove references
- Or protect against deleting them somehow*

Move colors out of RZConfig since its Client Specific

Hunters firing after dead
- Ive seen flare visualization after they are killed


RZ Features

Stairwell graphic tiles (NSEW, Up and Down)

Need much better AI for Hunters
- They should take cover
- They should flee
- They should make chase - If they encounter the player and the player breaks LoS, they should go to the player's last seen location
- They should have group tactics (spread out around player)

Better stat details in the window

Items should have stat effects and perhaps magical (lambda) effects
- Maybe rarity (green/blue/purple/orange)?

Server loads and updates all levels in the game
- Consider only updating levels that have active players
- This is causing a lot of processing overhead

Options menu
- New hotline miami is a nice simple example


RZ Potential issues

Doorways can be blocked if bodies die in front of them

Laggy while debugging
- Look at possibility of local semaphor packet sending?
