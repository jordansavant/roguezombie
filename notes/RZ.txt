RZ Bugs

Body's are LevelRunnable but if we delete one it will screw up references in the parent tile
- Tiles point to structures, doors or characters on them, deleting them needs to remove references
- Or protect against deleting them somehow*

Hunters firing after dead
- Ive seen flare visualization after they are killed
- On closer look it might be some left over from a grenade flair
- As if the grenade lighting is moving slightly past the Update ratio and rolling over?

Fat gap under Loot Interaction popup
- Only looks weird under singular loot option (like looting a dead guy)


RZ Features

Need much better AI for Hunters
- They should take cover
- They should flee
- They should make chase - If they encounter the player and the player breaks LoS, they should go to the player's last seen location
- They should have group tactics (spread out around player)

Items should have stat effects and perhaps magical (lambda) effects
- Maybe rarity (green/blue/purple/orange)?
- Better stat details in the window

Structures
- Cover structures, no purpose other than barricades


RZ Potential issues

Doorways can be blocked if bodies die in front of them

Laggy while debugging
- Look at possibility of local semaphor packet sending?
