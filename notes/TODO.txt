LEFT OFF:
- Biosprayer sound and lighting needs to be more like a spray

Bugs:

- After attacking I get free movement for 2 turns.. ???
	- IMPORTANT
- Walls on southern tip of map are messed up Z depths
- two people standing on either side of door, one walk away door close despite person being next to it, only close if count of people is 0
- if i destroy a body next to a door will it close?
- made things interactable while in combat but still have no hover effect on tiles
- can move partial amount and then attack in same turn
- Are tiles returning QuadIndexes and things back into the VertexMap?
	- Maybe through a pool? So they are not lost?

Improvements:

- Replace hunter AI with guard AI and expand on it to use weapon range instead of static distances
	- incorporate maximum weapon range
	- look at structures within effective range of the enemy, not myself
- Clicking on interactible structures, finds nearest tile and walks to it and then opens automatically
- debris/blood tile litter for effects etc
- scientists pose NO challenge (need some or other level0 bad guy)
	- hazmat workers (hardhats, crowbars)
- Mark access items on minimap with colors
- scientists need to feel more panicky, better sounds
- threaded level loader to load as we play
- devcmd: give weapons, heal, teleport
- rename furnishing to represent their dierction
- more loot! chests and bodies dont have surprises
	- mutagens, chemicals, implants
	- unknown 1-time-use items
	- terminals to learn about random items
- hover tile to get information about people, tiles, structures
- easy to destroy important game items for loot
	- check for this?
- room types for room decor
- have enemies look for you after breaking line of site
- better item information in inventory
- need to be able to read clues
	- scraps of paper
	- computer disks
- Use journal system to give me plot points
- Each level generates another plot machine
- unique attacks, such as something that can only strike at 2 away, not 3 or 1
- server effects for attack types, gonna have to be sprites
- refactor characters to be easier to add to

- Spawn one random enemy per room for that depth, don't spawn in entry rooms
