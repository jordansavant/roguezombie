RZ - Enemy Balancing

Writing automated tests for various characters and enemies should allow you to see how balanced something is over X iterations.

For example, set the player with a given set of items, a weapon, and stats against an enemy of certain items, stats and weapon.
Run combat scenarios in a test series to see how difficult it is, then adjust accordingly.

Monsters should follow the Brogue pattern of OOD and Depth characteristics that essentially define their level.
This will allow me to design monsters given certain stats, health and weapons in increasing power and define their level appearance.
This will also theme them with plot and level progression.
