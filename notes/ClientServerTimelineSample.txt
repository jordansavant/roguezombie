Client / Server Lifecycle

Client Starts
Client title loads
Client loads menu { multiplayer, singleplayer ..}
Client chooses multiplayer { host or connect }
Client chooses host

Host loads multiplayer state
Host spawns server thread

Send Time: 100ms
Client input sample time: 16.6ms
Client tick time: 50ms
Server update time: 16.6ms
Server tick time: 50ms

50 / 16.6667 = 2.9999999
Almost exactly three samples or simulations per packet

		HClient							Server
0										Listens on socket
1.0		Connects to socket
1.1										Accepts connection
1.1										Sends connection established packet
1.2		Accepts connection packet
1.2		Sends player credentials
1.3										Accepts player credentials
1.3										Adds player to world
1.3										Prepares FULL snapshot
1.3										Sends FULL snapshot
1.4		Accepts FULL Snapshot
1.5		Loads FULL Snapshot
1.6		Loads all entities and self

1.9		Client gets delta packet #1
		- compares x & y of sim time
		  to x & y of sent time
		- if match so no error
		- if no match smoothstep
		  correction to real x,y

		HClient							Server
		
		Client samples
		- QUIT command
		Client sends quit packet
		Client ends state
										Scenario #1:
										Server recieves quit packet
										Server removes client
										Server broadcasts player quit
										
										Scenario #2
										Server misses dropped quit packet
										Client times out after 2 seconds
										Server broadcasts disconnection
