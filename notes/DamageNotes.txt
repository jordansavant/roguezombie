Damage

Ranged Damage

	Ranged damage should be completely dependent on the weapon
		(round damage is nice and all but the prototype is not needing this)
	
	Weapon Damage range: 12 - 16
	rand(12, 16)
	
	Ranged damage suffers from static damages and can only be bolstered by critical hits
	
Melee Damage
	
	Melee damage should be based on the weapons damage, effected by the strength factor of the attacker
	
	Weapon Damage range: 12 - 16
	Strength Factor .4
	base = rand(12, 16) // 13
	dmg = base * SF * 2 // 10.4
	
	SF = .8
	base = rand(12, 16) // 13
	dmg = base * SF * 2 // 20.8


Damage Mitigation

	Bullets and melee strikes can have their damage mitigated by armors
	
	Currently there are the following pieces of armor:
		Head	= 2 effectiveness
		Chest	= 5 effectiveness
		Legs	= 4 effectiveness
		Feet	= 1 effectiveness
		Hands	= 1 effectiveness
		
		Total	= 13
	
	Each armor has a damageMitigation float between 0 - 1
	Total armor rating is 13 for each armor type
	Multiply the effectiveness of the armor against its type max effectiveness, add them up
	and divide over their total max effectiveness
	e.g
		head = .3, chest = .5, legs = .3, feet = .6, hands = 0
		.3 * 2 + .5 * 5 + .3 * 4 + .6 * 1 + 0 * 1
		= 4.9
		4.9 / 13
		= 0.377
		If the damage was 10, it would be
		10 - (10 * .377)
		= 6.23 mitigation
