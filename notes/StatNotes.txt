Dodge, Attack Rating

Dodging Melee
	Generally a stat like dex or agility would influence dodge
	A stat like strength would influence block
	
Dodging Ranged
	Kind of stupid and not reasonable to implement

Attack Rating
	My ability to overcome a dodge and a block
	A dodge plus a block is a parry and opens up a chance of counterattack
	
If an assailant attacks they must overcome both the dodge and block of a defender
If the defender both dodges and blocks successfully then the attack is considered a "Parry" and a countermelee is immediately affected
If the defender dodges xor blocks then the attack is a miss

Dodge is weighed against the speed/accuracy of the attack - speed/accuracy vs speed/accuracy
Block is weighed against the strength of the attack - strength vs strength
