Diablo II: Chance To Hit = 200% * {AR / (AR + DR)} * {Alvl / (Alvl + Dlvl)}
	AR = Attacker's Attack Rating
	DR = Defender's Defense rating
	Alvl = Attacker's level
	Dlvl = Defender's level
	Chance to hit is capped such that it can not be lower than 5% or higher than 95%.
	Defense Rating:
		Each equipment increases a flat armor rating
		Your dexterity attribute also increases your defense,
		 multiplying across the total armor value, and thus
		 adding to your dexterity will add to your defense
	Dexterity:
		A multiplier for your attack rating calculation
		 as well as your defense rating calculation

XCOM: Chance To Hit = Aim (unit stat + modifiers) - Defence (unit stat + modifiers) = total (clamped to 1%, if negative) + range modifier = final result

Chance of Hit
- Effected by the distance in combat
- Effected by any obstacles obstructing the attack and how obstructive they are
- Effected by the character's skill in using the weapon
- Effected by the character's stat for Dexterity
- Slightly effected by the Luck stat


RANGED

	RangedChanceOfHit = (1 - ObstructionPenalty) * RangeFactor * DexFactor;

	obstruction penalty
	- all bodies contain a 0-1 obstruction percentage
		- Defined by how much of a 1x1x1 object would be blocked by this object
	- take the max score of all bodies in the LoS

	range factor
	(ER / (ER + D))
	ER = Weapon Effect Range Stat (measured in distance of tiles)
	D = Distance to target (in tiles)
	(10 / (10 + 1)) = .9 => 90%
	(10 / (10 + 10)) = .5 => 50%
	(10 / (10 + 30)) = .25 => 25%
	(10 / (10 + 300)) = .03 => 3%

	dex factor
	Dex / AvgDex

Melee

	Obstruction factor, should be a nonissue because of melee
	Range factor, if the target is outside of the effective range then the chance of hit is 0, constantly
	
	If I swing at an object and want to hit it there are two primary reason it fails:
		1. I am inefficient at wielding it (to weak or clumsy)
		2. The target has a high melee dodge
	
	Modifying the D2 approach:
		200% * (AttackRating / AttackRating + DodgeRating)
		
	AttackRating
		Dexterity controls effectiveness at combat range
		Strength effects damage at melee range
		A combination of Strength and Dexterity is a good option
	
	DodgeRating
