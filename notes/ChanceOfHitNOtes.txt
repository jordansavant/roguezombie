Diablo II: Chance To Hit = 200% * {AR / (AR + DR)} * {Alvl / (Alvl + Dlvl)}
	AR = Attacker's Attack Rating
	DR = Defender's Defense rating
	Alvl = Attacker's level
	Dlvl = Defender's level
	Chance to hit is capped such that it can not be lower than 5% or higher than 95%.
	Defense Rating:
		Each equipment increases a flat armor rating
		Your dexterity attribute also increases your defense,
		 multiplying across the total armor value, and thus
		 adding to your dexterity will add to your defense
	Dexterity:
		A multiplier for your attack rating calculation
		 as well as your defense rating calculation

XCOM: Chance To Hit = Aim (unit stat + modifiers) - Defence (unit stat + modifiers) = total (clamped to 1%, if negative) + range modifier = final result

Chance of Hit
- Effected by the distance in combat
- Effected by any obstacles obstructing the attack and how obstructive they are
- Effected by the character's skill in using the weapon
- Effected by the character's stat for Dexterity
- Slightly effected by the Luck stat


RangedChanceOfHit = (1 - ObstructionPenalty) * RangeFactor * DexFactor;

obstruction penalty
- all bodies contain a 0-1 obstruction percentage
	- Defined by how much of a 1x1x1 object would be blocked by this object
- take the max score of all bodies in the LoS

range factor
(ER / (ER + D))
ER = Weapon Effect Range Stat (measured in distance of tiles)
D  = Distance to target (in tiles)
(10 / (10 + 1)) = .9 => 90%
(10 / (10 + 10)) = .5 => 50%
(10 / (10 + 30)) = .25 => 25%
(10 / (10 + 300)) = .03 => 3%

dex factor
Dex / AvgDex
